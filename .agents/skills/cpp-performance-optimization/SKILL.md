# C++ Performance Optimization

Use this skill only after parity is already proven for the target surface.

Read `references/official-guidance.md` before changing hot array paths,
container choices, or benchmark claims.

## Optimization order

1. Better data structures and data layout.
2. Fewer allocations, copies, and repeated scans.
3. Fewer process, FFI, and allocation-heavy boundary crossings.
4. Typed buffer entrypoints and native structs.
5. Only then smaller inner-loop or compile-time refinements.

## Workflow

1. Start from measured benchmark output, not intuition.
2. Rank cases by absolute Python/native C++ runtime and native C++ speedup
   over Python (`python_time / native_cpp_time`), treating ratios below `1.0x`
   as regressions.
3. Fix the biggest structural cost first:
   - choose the cheapest correct container or native layout for the access
     pattern
   - avoid node-heavy or copy-heavy structures in hot paths unless required
   - reduce repeated parsing or scanning of the same metadata
4. Remove boundary churn from hot paths:
   - repeated JSON parsing or serialization inside loops
   - repeated dict/list materialization
   - repeated `repr()` or string building on the success path
   - repeated CLI/FFI boundary crossings inside loops
5. Move semantics toward typed native structs and enums in `cpp/native/`.
6. Remove repeated work inside tight loops:
   - precompute reused invariants
   - hoist repeated scans or lookups
   - avoid rebuilding the same derived metadata on every iteration
7. Prefer contiguous native layouts and pre-sized containers in hot iteration
   paths. Use node-based or allocation-heavy structures only when the contract
   truly requires them.
8. In hot array paths, prefer typed C ABI buffers, native spans, or native
   structs over generic JSON or string conversion when the public contract
   allows it.
9. Use non-owning views such as `std::string_view` or spans only when the
   source lifetime is guaranteed for the full use-site and the Python-visible
   behavior stays identical.
10. Prefer move-friendly construction, `reserve`, and in-place population when
   they remove copies without changing the public semantics.
11. Push fixed lookup tables or deterministic shape metadata to compile time
   when the values are truly static and parity does not depend on runtime
   construction.
12. Keep C ABI wrappers thin. Move optimized loops into `cpp/native/`, and
   test the external ABI separately from core semantic timing.
13. Preserve exact output, exception behavior, ordering, dtype handling, and
   serialization semantics. Performance does not justify divergence.
14. Rebuild, rerun the narrow parity lane, then rerun the same benchmark case on
   the same machine class before claiming a speedup.
15. Report benchmark summaries in this order: Python time, native C++ time,
   time saved, native C++ time reduction, then native C++ speedup over Python
   (`python_time / native_cpp_time`).

## Guardrails

- Do not introduce unsafe math flags, approximate algorithms, or reordered
  semantics that change observable results.
- Do not apply a zero-copy view optimization across an FFI boundary unless the
  ownership and lifetime model is explicitly proven safe.
- Do not add concurrent execution to code whose ordering, floating-point
  accumulation, or exception timing is part of the public behavior unless
  parity is re-proven on that exact path.
- Do not apply PGO, host-specific flags, or parallel execution settings as a
  blanket repo claim unless the exact build profile and benchmark scope are
  stated.
- Do not claim native C++ `create` performance unless a parity-proven,
  registered native benchmark entrypoint for that surface exists and is paired
  with frozen-upstream Python timing.
- Do not replace a branch with branchless logic if that changes exception
  timing, overflow behavior, or short-circuit semantics.
- Do not trade away pure-native structure by moving semantics back into Python
  objects just because a short-term benchmark looks better.
