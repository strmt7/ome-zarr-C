# Verification Loop

Use this skill after any non-trivial change.

## Verification order

1. Relevant parity suites under `tests/`
2. `scripts/frozen_source_manifest.py --verify` when the claim depends on the
   frozen snapshot remaining exact
3. `scripts/check_native_cpp.py --all` when `cpp/` changed or a native-C++
   claim is being made
4. `ruff check .`
5. `ruff format --check .`
6. any module-specific build or benchmark check required by the touched files
   and, after native-code changes, rebuild the editable install first
7. after an automation-assisted push, wait for the GitHub workflows on that
   pushed commit and fix failures before considering the change finished
8. if workflows, CodeQL scope, or pinned tool versions changed, load
   `workflow-supply-chain-maintenance` and verify the exact scanner config or
   version source that justified the edit
9. when tests add shared helpers, ensure they import cleanly in both focused
   runs and whole-suite collection before treating the lane as green

## Reporting rule

State exactly which suites ran. Do not imply whole-repo parity when only one
ported surface was checked. After an automation-assisted push, state whether
the remote workflow set is green for that exact commit. If remote CI fails,
inspect the exact failing run logs for that repo before changing code.
